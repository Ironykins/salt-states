Salt states for personal use! 

These are provided publicly in hopes that others attempting to use salt to set up services on their home computers can use them as a reference.

I use some premade saltstack formulas as found [here](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas).
The repositories for these formulas are submoduled, since masterless salt setups do not yet support gitfs.

I have not tested these states extensively, and they are provided with no warranty or license. Steal them. Pee on them. Butcher them into some frankenstein monster. 

TODO:
* Pillar examples for existing configs
* OpenVPN Server
* NFS Setup
* PXE Boot Server
